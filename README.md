Esport was developed for a Carnegie Mellon course, 67-328, called Mobile to Cloud:Developing
Distributed Applications. The application was made for the course Term project where 
each student was given roughly 6 weeks to deploy an app to the Cloud. The app was built
in Node.js using express and MongoDb for database storage. The app was also built
with responsive design to cater to a mobile version of the application with much of
the content being different using mobile device detection. Front-end code was built using 
javascript with the main design coming from Bootstrap. Other features include session storage
and CRUD operations with user information via mongo.
